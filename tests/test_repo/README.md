# Hello Dev community! 
I'm noshishi, a apprentice engineer in Tokyo.
This article is about understanding Git from the inside by creating a simple program that `add` and `commit`.

**But it's a very long story, so I'll post the development section separately!**

# Foreword
The starting point is 'If I could understand git, I could make it?!!' 

I took this opportunity to try out a new programming language, so I decided to try Rust this time. The repository I actually created is [My original git nss](https://github.com/nopeNoshishi/nss). The quality of the code isn't quite there yet and many parts are still incomplete, but you can do a straight line of local development!

If you give me a **star**, I'll be happy to fly, and of course I'll be waiting for your contributions! Feel free to touch this repository any way you like!

**Please forgive us for not being able to explain some of the details in this article alone. Also, we use `Rust` for development, but `Python` for the stage where we uncover Git's internals!**
